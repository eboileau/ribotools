# Ribotools

**Ribotools**, an _add-on_ to [Rp-Bp](http://rp-bp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), is a toolbox for the analysis of matched ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data.

**Ribotools** can be used to generate count tables, starting from raw, trimmed reads, or existing alignments, taking into consideration Ribo-seq periodicity estimates and RNA-seq fragment length. **Ribotools** include scripts to perform translation efficiency (TE) analysis, accommodating for sample-to-sample variance, complex experimental designs, or confounding factors, and classifies features into different regulatory layers.
